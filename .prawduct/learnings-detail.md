# Learnings — detail

Evidence and worked instances for the rules in `learnings.md`. Headings match that
file's exactly, so a rule and its evidence stay findable from either side: the index
carries the rule, this carries what happened.

Entries older than 2026-07-31 still keep their evidence inline in `learnings.md`.
That is the shape the record linter asks them to leave, and moving them is its own
piece of work rather than a side effect of adding a rule — tracked as issue #26.

## A worked example with two cases checks itself, and nobody runs it

An artifact that illustrates a rule twice has stated the rule three times: once in
prose and once per case. Deriving the rule from one case and evaluating the other
is a free consistency check on the specification — and it is not a check anyone
performs, because a worked example reads as evidence rather than as a claim.

**Worked instance (2026-08-01).** `nonfunctional-requirements.md` § "The mat is
geometric, and the floor is physical" specifies the mat in inches with "the bottom
margin weighted larger than the top", and works the geometry twice — a 42" panel
and a 75" one. It gives no weighting factor, which is why this surfaced at all: a
box height cannot be computed from a direction, so the number had to come from
somewhere. Reading it back out of the 42" row gives 1.15, and that row then
reproduces exactly, to the pixel, including the rounding order (whole-pixel mat
first, bottom derived from the rounded top — carrying fractions to the end moves
the answer). Applying the same 1.15 to the 75" row gives 3546 x 1844 where the
artifact says 3546 x 1723. Its width matches and its height does not; 1723
implies a bottom weighting of 1.97.

**So at most one of the two rows was ever right, and the table had sat there since
July looking like arithmetic somebody had done.** It was cited as the
specification of an unbuilt component, which is the worst case: the next builder
follows it faithfully.

**Two things this is not.** It is not "check the maths" — the arithmetic in each
row is individually plausible and the error is only visible *across* rows. And it
is not caught by the sweep rules elsewhere in this file: nothing was amended, so
there was no decision to propagate and no claim to retire.

**The check, and it costs minutes:** when an artifact demonstrates a rule on more
than one case, derive the rule from one and evaluate the others against it. Where
the rule is arithmetic, do it in code and leave the code behind as a test keyed on
the artifact's own published figures — this table is now computed by
`Settings.tv_artwork_box` and pinned by `curation/tests/unit/test_config.py`, so
the artifact and the implementation can no longer drift apart in silence. A single
worked example has no such property and is worth correspondingly less; two is a
constraint.

## An idempotence test that holds the inputs still tests the wrong half

Re-running is only interesting because something may have changed since the last run; a test that re-runs over identical inputs proves the cheap half and leaves the reason for re-running uncovered.

**Worked instance (2026-08-01).** Chunk 10's seeder is required to be re-runnable.
Its `TestSeedingTwice` class covered two cases — the tree unchanged, and a render
arriving that had been missing — and both passed. The uncovered case was the one
the operation exists for: a **master replaced** between runs. There,
`record_rendition` re-stamped the existing render with the new master's hash, so
the old unregenerated render was declared current and `ExclusionReason.STALE_RENDITION`
could never fire again for any work a seed run had touched. The wall would show the
previous acquisition with nothing reporting it.

**The tell was in my own test names.** "Seeding twice does not grow the mat
history", "the second run creates nothing" — every one of them varied the *number
of runs* and held the *inputs* still. Idempotence is a claim about f(f(x)) = f(x)
for the x that actually occur, and the x that occurs on a second run is by
definition one that changed.

**The check:** for each re-run test, name what differs between run one and run two.
If the answer is "nothing", that is the trivial case, and at least one sibling test
has to change the input the operation reads.

## Adding code to a repo means asking which guards were scoped to the old shape

A mechanical guard silently narrows when the repo grows around it: it keeps passing, and the tree it no longer walks is the one nobody is watching.

**Worked instance (2026-08-01).** Two repo-level guards, both written before
`curation/` existed:

- `tests/test_repo_hygiene.py` sets `SOURCE_TREES` and did not list
  `curation/tests` — 30 files carrying nearly all of the plane's coverage. That
  guard exists *because* a stock `.gitignore` rule once matched
  `curation/src/curation/manifest/` on a case-insensitive filesystem and nearly
  lost the only channel between the planes. The tree it could not see was exactly
  the kind of tree it was built for.
- `tests/test_config.py::test_no_source_file_carries_a_deployment_value` globbed
  only `*.py` at the repo root, so the norm `project-preferences.md` *names it the
  enforcement artifact for* did not reach `curation/src` at all — the plane that
  has to run unchanged on the Pi and on a dev Mac once the legacy modules retire.

Neither had a violation, so neither ever went red. A green guard and an absent
guard are indistinguishable from the outside, which is why this needs a habit
rather than vigilance.

**The check, when adding a directory or a plane:** grep the test tree for path
literals and globs (`glob(`, `rglob(`, `parent.parent`, tuple-of-trees constants)
and ask of each whether it reaches the new code. Then prove it — plant the exact
violation the guard names in a file under the new tree and watch it fail.

**Second recurrence, 2026-08-01, and it widens the rule: a guard can narrow
itself.** The first two instances narrowed because the repo grew around a scope
written earlier. These two narrowed on their own, with no repo change involved,
which means "check the guards when you add a tree" is a necessary habit and not a
sufficient one.

- A new test refused any colour written outside the stylesheet's token blocks. It
  cut those blocks out with two non-greedy regexes, and **the second one ate
  three quarters of the file**: the `:root` pattern removed the dark scheme's
  *nested* `:root` as well as the top-level one, leaving that media query with a
  single closing brace, so the pattern hunting for `}` `}` ran on to the end of
  the stylesheet. Every component rule went unscanned. Planting a literal
  `#ff0000` in a rule reported clean.
- A new test asserted that a failed thumbnail write leaves no partial file. Its
  fixture fed the encoder a file that is not an image — so `Image.open` raised
  *before* `save` had created anything, and the test passed with the cleanup
  deleted outright. **The fixture could not reach the guard the test was named
  after.**

Both were found by taking the `test-evidence record` prompt literally — "name the
change that would flip it, and confirm the fixture REACHES the subject" — rather
than by review.

**What generalises: a guard's effective scope is invisible in its result.** Green
means "nothing was found in whatever I looked at", and the size of *whatever I
looked at* is exactly the thing no assertion states. So when a check computes its
own scope — a regex strip, a glob, a file list, a fixture that has to reach a
branch — assert the scope as well as the finding. The colour check now asserts
that what it scanned is more than half the stylesheet and contains six named
selectors; that second assertion is what makes the first one mean anything.

## Prose that ships to a caller is behaviour, and needs a test aimed at it

When a behaviour changes, the sweep has to reach the sentences that describe it to the caller — a tool tip, a `help` payload, an error hint — not only the artifacts and the docstrings; and where a tip states a rule the code enforces, pin them to each other with a test keyed on the enum of causes.

**A tool tip, a `help` payload, an error hint — anything the consumer reads before
deciding what to call — drifts exactly like code and is checked like documentation,
which is to say not at all.** When a behaviour changes, the sweep has to reach the
sentences that describe it to the caller, not only the artifacts and the docstrings.

**Worked instance (2026-07-31), and it recurred within one chunk.** Chunk 09
changed `art_theme(action='activate')` to publish the manifest. The service
docstring, the binding, `api-contract.md`, the acceptance criteria and a new test
all said so; the action's own tip still read "It does not itself rewrite the
manifest — call `art_display(action='sync')`". The Critic caught it. In the *same
commit that fixed it*, `show_now`'s refusal widened from archived-only to the whole
readiness rule — and its tip was missed the same way, caught by the next round.

Two things made both invisible. The tips are the one text with no assertion behind
them: `test_mcp_surface.py` pinned tool names, annotations, schemas and that every
declared action appears in the description, so a wrong *tip* was the one drift the
contract suite could not see. And a tip reads as commentary while functioning as
contract — this surface's primary consumer is a model, which acts on the tip and
never sees the docstring.

**The rule:** when a refusal, a precondition, or a side effect changes, grep the
tool records for the old rule as part of the same change — the artifacts are not
the end of the sweep. And where a tip states a rule the code enforces, **pin them
to each other**: enumerate the causes the code can raise, assert each is named in
the tip, and drive the real service to prove each documented refusal is one it
actually makes. A table keyed on the enum fails the day a sixth cause is added,
which is the day the tip would otherwise have gone quietly stale. See
`test_every_reason_show_now_can_refuse_for_is_named_in_its_tip`.
