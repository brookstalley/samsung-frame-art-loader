# Learnings

Accumulated wisdom from building this product.

## Platform and dependencies

See [platform-and-dependency-findings.md](artifacts/platform-and-dependency-findings.md)
for the full record established 2026-07-19. Summary:

- Target **Python 3.13** (matches Raspberry Pi OS Trixie), falling back to 3.12.
  Verified working on 3.12; 3.13 is an open assumption until a build proves it.
- Hardware is a **Pi 4 Model B**, so `RPi.GPIO` works and none of the Pi 5 /
  RP1 / `rpi-lgpio` complications apply.
- Both display drivers are **dormant** (omni-epd 2024-11, IT8951 2023-11), and
  the IT8951 dependency is **unpinned** — pin or vendor it.
- The hardware surface is only ~119 lines (`display.py`, `spi_test.py`), so it
  belongs behind an interface. That is what keeps a frozen 2023 driver from
  dictating the project's Python version.

## Data and cache contract

Established 2026-07-19. The `art/` tree is not one thing, and the two halves are
transported differently:

- **Upstream, expensive, device-independent** — `raw/`, `api-cache/`,
  `tile-cache/`. Costs network fetches and real API spend to regenerate.
- **Derived, cheap, device-specific** — `ready/`, `tv-thumbs/`, `label/`.
  Rendered for a particular target geometry (4K for the TV, 1448x1072 for the
  e-paper).

The rule that falls out:

> Git carries the code and the `all.json` index. Rsync carries the upstream
> blobs. Derived artifacts are never transported at all — they regenerate
> per-device.

Derived artifacts must **not** be copied between machines even though it is
technically possible: they are rendered for whichever display was targeted, so
shipping them produces either wrong output or a cache that cannot be trusted.
Regenerating them on the target is cheap and correct.

`all.json` is already the right shape for this — a 68 KB index tracked in git
while the blobs stay out of it. The design is sound; it needs making explicit,
starting with hoisting the art root into configuration as a single `ART_ROOT`
(it was hardcoded to `/home/tvpi/art`, correctly outside the repo, but only
implicitly).

## Known problems in the existing index

`all.json` conflates three separate concerns in one record, which the planned
pivot to canonical artwork identities plus a URL-resolution layer needs to
separate:

1. **Identity is the source URL.** If a museum site reorganises, identity
   breaks, and the same artwork cannot be sourced from two places.
2. **Per-device runtime state lives in the catalogue** — `tv_content_id` and
   `tv_content_thumb_md5` are facts about one specific television, and
   `label_file` embeds `_w648_h480`, geometry from a display that is no longer
   the target.
3. **Metadata is semi-structured** — `artist_details` is a newline-joined blob
   ("Charles Demuth\nAmerican, 1883-1935") needing parsing into artist,
   nationality, and lifespan.

Also unreconciled: **41 artworks in `all.json` but 46 files in `raw/`**, and
filenames encode identity in at least three mutually inconsistent conventions
(`Surname, Forename; Title; Year`, `Forename Surname - Title`, and at least one
`Title - Forename Surname` with the fields reversed).
