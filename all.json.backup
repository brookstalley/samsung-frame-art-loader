To release images of this higher realm, the Surrealists embraced automatism, a spontaneous working method much like free association. Mir\u00f3 experimented with automatism: \u201cEven a few casual wipes in cleaning my brush,\u201d he said, \u201cmay suggest the beginning of a picture.\u201d Between 1925 and 1927, his experiments unleashed a revolutionary series of works called the \u201cdream paintings,\u201d which straddle abstraction and representation in freely moving, calligraphic compositions. In <em>The Policeman</em>, a large canvas from this group, two biomorphic shapes spring to life as a policeman and a horse, their forms defined by thinly applied white paint against a neutral ocher ground. The form on the left has sprouted five buds that act as fingers, and both forms extrude curves that suggest torsos or mouths. With sketch-like dots and squiggles added to their heads to make eyes and a mustache, Mir\u00f3\u2019s shapes come to life in a liquid space as animated equivalents of a policeman and his horse.</p>\n",

                "description": "<p>Painted in the summer of 1965, when Georgia O\u2019Keeffe was 77 years old, this monumental work culminates a series inspired by the artist\u2019s experiences as an airplane passenger during the 1950s. Working in Abiquiu, New Mexico, O\u2019Keeffe began around 1963 to capture the endless expanses of clouds she had observed from airplane windows during trips all over the world. Beginning with a relatively realistic depiction of small white clouds on a three-by-four-foot canvas, she progressed to more stylized images of the motif on larger surfaces. O\u2019Keeffe wrote:</p>\n<p>&quot;I painted a painting eight feet high and twenty-four feet wide\u2014it kept me working every minute from six a.m. till eight or nine at night as I had to be finished before it was cold\u2014I worked in the garage and it had no heat\u2014Such a size is of course ridiculous but I had it in my head as something I wanted to do for a couple of years.&quot;</p>\n<p>In 1970 <em>Sky above Clouds IV</em> was scheduled to be included in a retrospective of O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s work at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the San Francisco Museum of Art. After being shown in New York and Chicago, the painting was determined to be too large to enter the doors of the museum in San Francisco. It thus remained on loan to the Art Institute for more than a decade, while the artist and public-minded collectors of her art arranged for it to join the museum\u2019s permanent collection.</p>\n<p>The special relationship between O\u2019Keeffe and the Art Institute began in 1905, when she enrolled as a student at the School of the Art Institute. Her first museum retrospective was organized here in 1943. Later, as the executor for the estate of her husband, the pioneering American photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, O\u2019Keeffe presented the Art Institute with an important group of modernist works, including a number of her own, many of which are on view in the galleries of American art. She continued to make significant additions to this bequest until her death, at age 98, in 1986.</p>\n",

Breaking with the currents of the time, he adopted direct carving, combined different materials for single works, and simplified form in his search for his subjects\u2019 essential characters. His works have profoundly influenced the development of twentieth-century abstraction.</p>\n<p>More than any other theme, Brancusi\u2019s series <em>Bird</em> summarizes his quest for a self-sufficient form. \u201cAll my life, I have sought to render the essence of flight,\u201d the artist once said. He began the first of twenty-seven <em>Bird</em> sculptures around 1910 and completed the last in the 1940s. He called the earliest variations <em>Maiastra</em>, referring to a bird in Romanian folklore that leads a prince to his princess. In the Art Institute\u2019s <em>Golden Bird</em>, details such as feet, a tail, and an upturned crowing beak are only suggested in an elegant, streamlined silhouette. Br\u00e2ncusi perched this refined shape on a rough-hewn, geometric base, contrasting the disembodied, light-reflective surface with an earthbound mass. The central polyhedron was cut from the middle of a tree trunk, and its circles (indicating the tree\u2019s age) rotate like a sun, as if radiating light over the bird.</p>\n",

Louis Sullivan\u2019s foremost student, Wright continued his teacher\u2019s search for an indigenous American architecture. Like Sullivan, Wright drew inspiration from nature and natural forms, and both men were pioneers of the Prairie School of architecture, characterized by low-slung, horizontal lines and rambling, open spaces that reflect the gently rolling landscape of the Midwest. Odes to the middle-class American family at the turn of the century, Wright\u2019s residences are organic, designed not only to adapt to a family\u2019s changing structure but also to contain the sense of a unified and harmonious whole. Every detail of the Coonley complex, like all of Wright\u2019s projects, bore his personal imprint, down to the creation and placement of the furniture and the design of this window. Referencing such Americana as the flag and colored balloons, Wright explored the use of glass both as a transparent screen uniting exterior and interior and as a decorative element, the colors and design of which anticipate the later abstractions of Piet Mondrian.</p>\n",

He was largely self-taught, and as a teacher at Chicago\u2019s Institute of Design (1946\u201361), he continued to learn by assigning photographic problems to students and then solving them himself. Influenced by both the classicism of Ansel Adams and the experimentalism of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, Callahan fused formal precision and exploration with personal subjectivity. He photographed a wide range of subjects\u2014female pedestrians lost in thought on Chicago\u2019s streets; architectural facades; his wife, Eleanor; and weeds and grasses in snow. <em>Chicago</em>, one of his best-known pictures, shows trees covered in snow along Chicago\u2019s Lake Shore Drive. Although Callahan captured all of the detail available in the bark and snow in his negative, he purposely printed this image in high contrast to emphasize the black-and-white forms of the trees against the stark backdrop.

These instantly recognizable images allowed him to reintroduce subject matter into his work, freeing him to explore other painterly concerns. One of the found images that Johns employed was the target, and from 1955 to 1961 the artist produced several dozen paintings and drawings that explored this device.</p>\n<p>Initially, Johns chose a palette of primary colors, a preexisting schema as found as the image itself. The artist\u2019s use of oil and encaustic (pigment mixed with hot wax) created a quick-drying medium that recorded each drag and drip of the brush in almost sculptural terms. Indeed, these gestural nods to his Abstract predecessors allowed him to investigate the subtle nuances between form and material.

He was interested in the temporal character of music and its possible translation into forms of art. Works like <em>Sunset</em> reflect the principles of rhythm: linear structures, forms, and tonal values are orchestrated into a measured, vibrating image. To produce such a harmonious effect, Klee layered an intricate pattern of dots over a neutral background. Abstract, geometric, and overlapping shapes balance with recognizable forms, such as the schematic face in the upper left and the red sun and arrow in the lower right. The resulting composition\u2014balancing stillness and movement, shallowness and depth\u2014relates to Klee\u2019s larger project of looking to music to produce an art that \u201cdoes not reproduce the visible, but makes visible.\u201d</p>\n",

                "description": "<p>Shimmering concentric circles of silver and blue radiate downward from the deep black center of the sun, dwarfing its tiny reflection in the water below. Although Arthur Dove experimented early on with abstraction, in the 1920s he developed a unique representational style that simplified elements and toyed with scale to capture the fundamental forms and forces of nature. Dove was equally fascinated with the materials of art and here mixed metallic paint with something like wax to thicken its consistency. The textured brushwork emphasizes the sun\u2019s brilliance, making its rays almost tangible.</p>\n",

By directly staining the canvas with many thin washes of pigment and paying particular attention to the edges where the fields interact, he achieved the effect of light radiating from the image itself. This technique suited Rothko\u2019s metaphysical aims: to offer painting as a doorway into purely spiritual realms, making it as immaterial and evocative as music, and to directly communicate the most essential, raw forms of human emotion.</p>\n",
