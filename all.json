The building was part of the industrial landscape in his hometown of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which Demuth began depicting with increasing monumentality in the last years of his life.

Demuth drew the title from the last line of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d which was adopted as the United States national anthem the year he painted this work, thus implying that for many workers, the factory was the new \u201chome of the brave.\u201d</p>\n",

To release images of this higher realm, the Surrealists embraced automatism, a spontaneous working method much like free association. Mir\u00f3 experimented with automatism: \u201cEven a few casual wipes in cleaning my brush,\u201d he said, \u201cmay suggest the beginning of a picture.\u201d Between 1925 and 1927, his experiments unleashed a revolutionary series of works called the \u201cdream paintings,\u201d which straddle abstraction and representation in freely moving, calligraphic compositions. In <em>The Policeman</em>, a large canvas from this group, two biomorphic shapes spring to life as a policeman and a horse, their forms defined by thinly applied white paint against a neutral ocher ground. The form on the left has sprouted five buds that act as fingers, and both forms extrude curves that suggest torsos or mouths. With sketch-like dots and squiggles added to their heads to make eyes and a mustache, Mir\u00f3\u2019s shapes come to life in a liquid space as animated equivalents of a policeman and his horse.</p>\n",

                "description": "<p>Painted in the summer of 1965, when Georgia O\u2019Keeffe was 77 years old, this monumental work culminates a series inspired by the artist\u2019s experiences as an airplane passenger during the 1950s. Working in Abiquiu, New Mexico, O\u2019Keeffe began around 1963 to capture the endless expanses of clouds she had observed from airplane windows during trips all over the world. Beginning with a relatively realistic depiction of small white clouds on a three-by-four-foot canvas, she progressed to more stylized images of the motif on larger surfaces. O\u2019Keeffe wrote:</p>\n<p>&quot;I painted a painting eight feet high and twenty-four feet wide\u2014it kept me working every minute from six a.m. till eight or nine at night as I had to be finished before it was cold\u2014I worked in the garage and it had no heat\u2014Such a size is of course ridiculous but I had it in my head as something I wanted to do for a couple of years.&quot;</p>\n<p>In 1970 <em>Sky above Clouds IV</em> was scheduled to be included in a retrospective of O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s work at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the San Francisco Museum of Art. After being shown in New York and Chicago, the painting was determined to be too large to enter the doors of the museum in San Francisco. It thus remained on loan to the Art Institute for more than a decade, while the artist and public-minded collectors of her art arranged for it to join the museum\u2019s permanent collection.</p>\n<p>The special relationship between O\u2019Keeffe and the Art Institute began in 1905, when she enrolled as a student at the School of the Art Institute. Her first museum retrospective was organized here in 1943. Later, as the executor for the estate of her husband, the pioneering American photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, O\u2019Keeffe presented the Art Institute with an important group of modernist works, including a number of her own, many of which are on view in the galleries of American art. She continued to make significant additions to this bequest until her death, at age 98, in 1986.</p>\n",

Breaking with the currents of the time, he adopted direct carving, combined different materials for single works, and simplified form in his search for his subjects\u2019 essential characters. His works have profoundly influenced the development of twentieth-century abstraction.</p>\n<p>More than any other theme, Brancusi\u2019s series <em>Bird</em> summarizes his quest for a self-sufficient form. \u201cAll my life, I have sought to render the essence of flight,\u201d the artist once said. He began the first of twenty-seven <em>Bird</em> sculptures around 1910 and completed the last in the 1940s. He called the earliest variations <em>Maiastra</em>, referring to a bird in Romanian folklore that leads a prince to his princess. In the Art Institute\u2019s <em>Golden Bird</em>, details such as feet, a tail, and an upturned crowing beak are only suggested in an elegant, streamlined silhouette. Br\u00e2ncusi perched this refined shape on a rough-hewn, geometric base, contrasting the disembodied, light-reflective surface with an earthbound mass. The central polyhedron was cut from the middle of a tree trunk, and its circles (indicating the tree\u2019s age) rotate like a sun, as if radiating light over the bird.</p>\n",

Louis Sullivan\u2019s foremost student, Wright continued his teacher\u2019s search for an indigenous American architecture. Like Sullivan, Wright drew inspiration from nature and natural forms, and both men were pioneers of the Prairie School of architecture, characterized by low-slung, horizontal lines and rambling, open spaces that reflect the gently rolling landscape of the Midwest. Odes to the middle-class American family at the turn of the century, Wright\u2019s residences are organic, designed not only to adapt to a family\u2019s changing structure but also to contain the sense of a unified and harmonious whole. Every detail of the Coonley complex, like all of Wright\u2019s projects, bore his personal imprint, down to the creation and placement of the furniture and the design of this window. Referencing such Americana as the flag and colored balloons, Wright explored the use of glass both as a transparent screen uniting exterior and interior and as a decorative element, the colors and design of which anticipate the later abstractions of Piet Mondrian.</p>\n",

Influenced by both the classicism of Ansel Adams and the experimentalism of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, Callahan fused formal precision and exploration with personal subjectivity. He photographed a wide range of subjects\u2014female pedestrians lost in thought on Chicago\u2019s streets; architectural facades; his wife, Eleanor; and weeds and grasses in snow. <em>Chicago</em>, one of his best-known pictures, shows trees covered in snow along Chicago\u2019s Lake Shore Drive. Although Callahan captured all of the detail available in the bark and snow in his negative, he purposely printed this image in high contrast to emphasize the black-and-white forms of the trees against the stark backdrop. With a graphic sensibility typical of the Institute of Design, Callahan reminds the viewer that a photograph is first and foremost an arrangement of tones and shapes on a piece of paper.</p>\n",

He took the radical step of destroying his previous work and began painting a set of motifs that included numbers, the American flag, and the alphabet. These instantly recognizable images allowed him to reintroduce subject matter into his work, freeing him to explore other painterly concerns. One of the found images that Johns employed was the target, and from 1955 to 1961 the artist produced several dozen paintings and drawings that explored this device.</p>\n<p>Initially, Johns chose a palette of primary colors, a preexisting schema as found as the image itself. The artist\u2019s use of oil and encaustic (pigment mixed with hot wax) created a quick-drying medium that recorded each drag and drip of the brush in almost sculptural terms. Indeed, these gestural nods to his Abstract predecessors allowed him to investigate the subtle nuances between form and material. There also exists a tension between the idea of the representational (a target) and the notion of the abstract (the geometry of concentric circles).</p>\n",

While living in Europe between 1948 and 1954, the artist encountered winged altarpieces in churches and cathedrals, which sparked his interest in works composed of separate pieces. He began arranging the colors of his paintings using chance techniques, removing himself from decisions that would influence the aesthetic of the finished artwork. Rather than use handmade marks in this piece, Kelly relied on intersecting edges and flat planes of monochrome color to express form.</p>\n",

                "description": "<p>Paul Klee was an artist and teacher at the Bauhaus for most of that famed school\u2019s existence. Initially head of the bookbinding department, Klee made his greatest contribution as a lecturer on the theory of form in art for the basic design course. There, he developed his ideas about the \u201cpolyphony\u201d of painting\u2014the simultaneous effect of formal elements that produces \u201ca transformed beholder of art.\u201d</p>\n<p>Klee was also a trained musician and shared with many artists of the early twentieth century the idea that music was the key to producing a new, abstract art. He was interested in the temporal character of music and its possible translation into forms of art. Works like <em>Sunset</em> reflect the principles of rhythm: linear structures, forms, and tonal values are orchestrated into a measured, vibrating image. To produce such a harmonious effect, Klee layered an intricate pattern of dots over a neutral background. Abstract, geometric, and overlapping shapes balance with recognizable forms, such as the schematic face in the upper left and the red sun and arrow in the lower right. The resulting composition\u2014balancing stillness and movement, shallowness and depth\u2014relates to Klee\u2019s larger project of looking to music to produce an art that \u201cdoes not reproduce the visible, but makes visible.\u201d</p>\n",

In ibid., vol. 4, 1994, p. 193, no. 1421, p. 198, no. 1429, p. 273, no. 1563, and pp. 275\u201376, nos. 1566 and 1568). Magritte first realized the idea and conceived the title for this series in the first of these gouaches completed in 1956 shortly after he announced to Mirabelle Dors and Maurice Rapin, in a letter of November 9, 1956, that \"Le Banquet\" was one of his latest \"finds\" (ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 267). The little sketch in this letter shows the main motif of the sun visible before a clump of trees set in an unspecified landscape. In the first oil version (as in the earlier related image, <em>The Sixteenth of September</em>, 1956, location unknown; ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 254, no. 834, ill., which shows the crescent moon on a large tree), the clump of trees is set in a meadowlike clearing dotted with large stones. In the second oil version of <em>The Banquet</em>, as in the Bergman canvas, the woodland glade is replaced with a stone parapet or balustrade, whose top is lit by the sun's rays. This feature suggests a parklike setting, a domesticated concept of nature suited to Magritte's deadpan, realist style. The proportions of the objects in relation to one another also differ from canvas to canvas; in the picture under dis\u00adcussion, the sun looms larger in relation to the trees than in other versions and appears therefore closer to the viewer. It is interesting that, although the motif in essential respects is identical, significant variations mark each version as a distinct image. </p>\n <p>The Banquet series is a development of another se\u00adries on which Magritte had started working in February 1956 and which he called <em>The Place in the Sun</em>. In these pictures, Magritte focused on the Surrealist idea of displacement, but with a particular twist. One object was superimposed on another larger one to which it was unrelated. The original series included an image of a seated scribe superimposed on an apple (ibid., vol.  3, 1993, pp. 252\u201353, no. 833, ill.) and Sandro Botticell\u2019s <em>Primavera</em> silhouetted against a figure in a bowler hat seen from behind (ibid., vol. 3, 1998, p. 258, no. 837, ill.). Magritte's approach in these pictures resembled what he referred to as \"Objective stimulus,'' a term he applied to those instances in which he replaced an object familiar to a particular context with one related to it but out of place, as he did in his 1933 painting <em>Elective Affinities</em> of a huge egg in a birdcage (Paris, E. Perier; Sarah Whitfield, <em>Magritte</em>, London, The Hayward Gallery, 1992, exh. cat., no. 60, ill., n. pag.). As he explained to Rapin, <em>The Place in the Sun</em> is if you like an 'Objective stimulus' with the difference that the image which comes 'on' another has a still greater charge of strangeness (ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 253). In a subsequent letter to Dors and Rapin, Magritte wrote of <em>The Sixteenth of September</em>, \"I have continued with my 'Places in the Sun' but by now the title is no longer suitable for a big tree in the evening with a crescent moon above it!\" (ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 254). The object that would have been hidden (crescent moon, sun) is now visible, hiding part of the object that would have hidden it. </p>\n <p>These works are striking examples of Magritte's interest in the categories of the visible and the invisible. In a letter to Andr\u00e9 Bosmans of September 25, 1964, Magritte explained:</p>\n <p>\n<em>With regard to \"the invisible,\" I understand that which is not visible, for example; heat, weight, pleasure, etc. There is the</em> visible that is seen: <em>the apple on the face in</em> The Great War, <em>and the</em> visible that is hidden: <em>the face hidden by the visible apple. In</em> The Banquet <em>the sun hidden by the curtain of trees is, itself, visible</em> (Ren\u00e9 Magritte, <em>Lettres \u00e0 Andr\u00e9 Bosmans, 1958-1967</em>, ed. by Francine Perceval, Brussels, 1990, p. 383).\n</p>\n<p>According to the above criteria, the sun hidden by trees is an example of the \"visible that is hidden.\" In <em>the Banquet</em> series, Magritte carried the implications of these reflections one step further: he actually rendered the sun visible by creating a visual conundrum, in which the sun is not displaced from its customary context, but rendered strange. </p>\n <p>At this time Magritte seems to have been interested, moreover, in the varying quality of light at different times of day. Of the second version of <em>The Sixteenth of September</em> (1956, Antwerp, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten; ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 257, no. 836, ill.), he wrote to Dors and Rapin on August 6, 1956: \"I have just painted the moon on a tree in the gray-blue colors of evening\" (ibid.). In the Bergman version of <em>The Banquet,</em> the strong red glow of the setting sun is framed by the darkening landscape, a naturalistic effect that further dramatizes the \"charge of strangeness\" (Magritte, quoted in ibid., vol. 3, 1993, p. 253). </p>\n <p>The Bergman painting also has a strong formal quality, with the sun as a pure circle in the center, balanced by the strong architectural horizontal of the balustrade. In this respect, the picture recalls Max Ernst's Forest series of the late 1920s (<em>Ernst Katalog</em>, vol. 3, pp. 180-209, nos. 1140-96, ills.), where the circular forms of sun or moon work pictorially in both an abstract and figurative sense. </p>\n<p>\u2013Entry, Dawn Ades, <em>Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago</em> (Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago, 1997), pp. 172\u201374, cat. 86.</p>\n",

The canvas of <em>Untitled (Painting)</em> burns with subtle variations of orange and yellow hues. The painting follows the characteristic format of Rothko\u2019s mature work, according to which stacked rectangles of color appear to float within the boundaries of the canvas. By directly staining the fabric of the canvas with many thin washes of pigment and by paying particular attention to the edges where the fields interact, he achieved the effect of light radiating from the image itself. This technique suited his metaphysical aims: to offer painting as a doorway into purely spiritual realms, making it as immaterial and evocative as music, and to communicate directly the most essential, rawest forms of human emotion. Rothko described his art as the \u201celimination of all obstacles between the painter and the idea, between the idea and the observer.\u201d In place of overt symbolism, he used color, overwhelming scale, and surface luminosity to elicit an emotive, profound response from the viewer.</p>\n",

                "description": "<p>Along with Grant Wood and Thomas Hart Benton, John Steuart Curry attained significant fame as one of the three most important Regionalist painters of the 1930s. In 1941 Wood wrote about Curry: \u201cIt was action he loved most to interpret: the lunge through space, the split second before the kill, the suspended moment before the storm strikes.\u201d <em>Hogs Killing a Snake</em> reveals his fascination with the violence of nature and the struggle for survival. Curry deliberately constructed the dynamic composition to heighten the vitality of his subject; the hogs converge from all angles upon the writhing snake, giving a sense of violent motion. Curry accentuated the vigor of the composition with his painting technique, using short, choppy brushstrokes and even scratching on the surface of the paint to suggest the bristling hair on the hogs\u2019 backs. Although the subject was ostensibly drawn from a childhood experience, the painting transcends mere realism to become nearly epic.</p>\n",

                "description": "<p>Ellsworth Kelly explored the fundamentals of color, line, and form, yet the basis of his abstraction always lay in his observations of natural and built environments. <em>Train Landscape</em>, which Kelly made during his formative years in Paris (from 1948 to 1954), draws its vivid colors from nature. The title refers to fields of lettuce, spinach, and mustard that the young artist viewed from a train while speeding through the French countryside\u2014this perceptual blur here pushed to the extreme of a flat, pristine monochrome. The multipanel composition emphasizes the status of the painting as an object on the wall, with a shape, density, and heft of its own.</p>\n",
